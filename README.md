## Description
I created a project called 'events' where users can:
- Register with email and password
- Login with email and password
- Change Password
- Change registered email
- Create your own events
- Edit your own events
- Disable and enable your own events
- Delete your own events
- View all logged events
- Register and withdraw from an event
